## Running "morni banke" on a vehicle

See [README](/README.md) in the root of this repository for detailed instructions if you want to create your own custom lightshows.

TLDR;
- Unzip morni_lightshow.zip in a **BLANK** USB flash drive. 
- Insert the flash drive into one of the front USB or USB-C ports, or glovebox USB port, then wait a few seconds.
- In Toybox, select Light Show and tap Start The Show. If the files on the USB flash drive meet the requirements, then the custom show will be used instead of the built-in show.
